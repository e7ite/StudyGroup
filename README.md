## Description
This was a group project among 4 students in the CSCI 430 Software Engineering class at California State University, Chico in Spring 2020. The goal was to make an iPhone/Android application which can provide to students on campus to have a way to create and join study groups on any school subject. Students, with the help of this application, will have an easy-to-use, stylish, and effective way to prepare for exams, work on homework, and make new friends!

We used the Agile software development model to develop this project. We had weekly Scrum meetings to monitor everyone's progress. If we had any blockers we would make sure to address them to make steady progress throughout the semester. We collaborated with entrepeneurs in the MGMT 450 class. They would get feedback to us by doing research and getting us statistics in what the public would want in order for us to better create our product.  We also did Sprint Planning every two weeks and did a Sprint Review at the end of those two weeks to summarize what we have done and what we will do next. We made sure we had some type of feature implemented by the end of these Sprints in order to get feedback from the entrepeneurs and help better develop our project.

The coverage is low because we ran out of time to be able to implement more tests near the end of the class because we all had finals to prepare for and didn't have enough time to implement more tests
